= Hibernate and EclipseLink in an OSGi Runtime and Eclipse 4

This repo shows how to use JPA in an OSGi environment and with Eclipse 4.

It provides products for both EclipseLink and Hibernate.

== Building and running the projects

[source, console]
----
cd com.vogella.jpa
./mvnw clean verify
----

After the successful build you can navigate to either the _/home/simon/git/com.vogella.jpa/com.vogella.jpa.product.eclipselink/target/products/vogella-jpa-eclipselink/***your OS***/***your ws***/***your arch***/vogella-jpa-eclipselink_ or _/com.vogella.jpa/com.vogella.jpa.product.hibernate/target/products/vogella-jpa-hibernate/***your OS***/***your ws***/***your arch***/vogella-jpa-hibernate_ and run the _vogella-jpa-eclipselink_ or _vogella-jpa-hibernate_ runnable.

== Architecture

The _com.vogella.jpa.e4.client_ bundle, which contains the Eclipse 4 application and implicitly uses EclipseLink or Hibernate is completely decoupled from the underlying ORM mapper.

== Hibernate vs. EclipseLink

I do not want to compare these two JPA implementations, but just mention that it is easier to include EclipseLink into a project, which uses an OSGi runtime, e.g., Eclipse, because for Hibernate it was still necessary to add the `Eclipse-BuddyPolicy: registered` instruction in the models _MANIFEST.MF_ file and to register the _com.vogella.jpa.service.eclipselink_ project as buddy (`Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: com.vogella.jpa.model`).

TIP: See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Context_Class_Loader_Enhancements for further information.

Another point is that EclipseLink provides their OSGi bundles in a p2 update site (http://download.eclipse.org/rt/eclipselink/updates/) and Hibernate had to be added to the dependencies project, which generates a p2 update site. See <<dependencies-project>> for further information.

== Development

Building the project with Maven Tycho is nice, but as a developer you might want to see the code und run it from the Eclipse IDE. Therefore just clone and import the project, set the target platform, which is specified in the _com.vogella.jpa.target_ project, and run the _com.vogella.jpa.eclipselink.product_ product *or* the _com.vogella.jpa.hibernate.product_ product.

== The Projects

[[dependencies-project]]
=== dependencies

The dependencies projects uses https://github.com/stempler/bnd-platform[bnd-platform] in order to generate a p2 update site for the H2 database and the Hibernate hibernate dependencies.
See https://github.com/SimonScholz/com.vogella.jpa/blob/master/dependencies/build.gradle[build.gradle] and https://github.com/stempler/bnd-platform/blob/master/README.md[bnd-platforms documentation] to see how this is done.

But no worries the p2 update site, which is generated is already available here: https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/H2-Database-Engine/ and also being used in the target platform definition file.

=== com.vogella.jpa.target

This project consists of a _com.vogella.jpa.target.target_ target definition file, which should be set as target platform for the workspace so that all projects compile.

=== com.vogella.jpa.model

This is a simple data model for the clients containing a `Todo` entity and an `TodoService` interface, but completely decoupled from EclipseLink or Hibernate. So it is pretty much like a DAO or a Spring data repository.

=== com.vogella.jpa.service.eclipselink and com.vogella.jpa.service.hibernate

Implement the `TodoService` interface and registers this implementation as an OSGi service so that it can the obtained by clients.

Depending on which product is started com.vogella.jpa.service.eclipselink *or* com.vogella.jpa.service.hibernate will be part of the product and therefore provide the actual implementation of the `TodoService`.

=== com.vogella.jpa.e4.client

This client is an Eclipse 4 RCP application, which only has a dependency to the _com.vogella.jpa.model_ package and simply injects the `TodoService` into a sample part in order to show `Todo` objects in a sample part.

Please feel free to add new features like deleting or adding `Todo` objects, since the `TodoService` service already offers these methods as well. 

=== Other projects

The other projects are just containing the features and products for either EclipseLink *or* Hibernate.

== Contributing

Feedback is highly appreciated and pull requests are appreciated even more.

So please feel free to ask for enhancements or offer pull requests for missing features.
